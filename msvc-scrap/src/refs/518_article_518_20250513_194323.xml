  <abstract>BackgroundAccurate determination of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is important for choosing optimal HER2 targeting treatment strategies. HER2-low is currently considered HER2-negative, but patients may be eligible to receive new anti-HER2 drug conjugates.PurposeTo use breast MRI BI-RADS features for classifying three HER2 levels, first to distinguish HER2-zero from HER2-low/positive (Task-1), and then to distinguish HER2-low from HER2-positive (Task-2).Study typeRetrospective.Population621 invasive ductal cancer, 245 HER2-zero, 191 HER2-low, and 185 HER2-positive. For Task-1, 488 cases for training and 133 for testing. For Task-2, 294 cases for training and 82 for testing.Field strength/sequence3.0 T; 3D T1-weighted DCE, short time inversion recovery T2, and single-shot EPI DWI.AssessmentPathological information and BI-RADS features were compared. Random Forest was used to select MRI features, and then four machine learning (ML) algorithms: decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), and artificial neural nets (ANN), were applied to build models.Statistical testsChi-square test, one-way analysis of variance, and Kruskal-Wallis test were performed.
