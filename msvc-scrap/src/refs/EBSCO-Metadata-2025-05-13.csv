eBook Academic Collection (EBSCOhost),e000xww,2757915,"Automated Machine Learning : Hyperparameter Optimization, Neural Architecture Search, and Algorithm Selection with Cloud Platforms","Get to grips with automated machine learning and adopt a hands-on approach to AutoML implementation and associated methodologiesKey FeaturesGet up to speed with AutoML using OSS, Azure, AWS, GCP, or any platform of your choiceEliminate mundane tasks in data engineering and reduce human errors in machine learning modelsFind out how you can make machine learning accessible for all users to promote decentralized processesBook DescriptionEvery machine learning engineer deals with systems that have hyperparameters, and the most basic task in automated machine learning (AutoML) is to automatically set these hyperparameters to optimize performance. The latest deep neural networks have a wide range of hyperparameters for their architecture, regularization, and optimization, which can be customized effectively to save time and effort. This book reviews the underlying techniques of automated feature engineering, model and hyperparameter tuning, gradient-based approaches, and much more. You'll discover different ways of implementing these techniques in open source tools and then learn to use enterprise tools for implementing AutoML in three major cloud service providers: Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud Platform. As you progress, you'll explore the features of cloud AutoML platforms by building machine learning models using AutoML. The book will also show you how to develop accurate models by automating time-consuming and repetitive tasks in the machine learning development lifecycle. By the end of this machine learning book, you'll be able to build and deploy AutoML models that are not only accurate, but also increase productivity, allow interoperability, and minimize feature engineering tasks.What you will learnExplore AutoML fundamentals, underlying methods, and techniquesAssess AutoML aspects such as algorithm selection, auto featurization, and hyperparameter tuning in an applied scenarioFind out the difference between cloud and operations support systems (OSS)Implement AutoML in enterprise cloud to deploy ML models and pipelinesBuild explainable AutoML pipelines with transparencyUnderstand automated feature engineering and time series forecastingAutomate data science modeling tasks to implement ML solutions easily and focus on more complex problemsWho this book is forCitizen data scientists, machine learning developers, artificial intelligence enthusiasts, or anyone looking to automatically build machine learning models using the features offered by open source tools, Microsoft Azure Machine Learning, AWS, and Google Cloud Platform will find this book useful. Beginner-level knowledge of building ML models is required to get the best out of this book.
