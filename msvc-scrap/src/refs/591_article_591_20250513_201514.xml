  <abstract>A method, system, and computer program product for generating lineage events of machine learning models. The method may include identifying a machine learning model with missing lineage. The method may also include generating a creation event and deployment event for the machine learning model. The method may also include generating a version change event for the machine learning model. Generating the version change event may include identifying one or more predicted data points with a low model confidence; rescoring the one or more predicted data points based on the machine learning model at a second time period; determining that the updated one or more predicted data points are significantly different than the one or more predicted data points; and determining that there is a new version of the machine learning model. The method may also include creating a lineage path for the machine learning model.</abstract>
